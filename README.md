Go to https://script.google.com/home

Save the project. I used “ColorEvents”. You can use any name you want, but note where you need to remember the script name in later instructions. 

Click the ‘Play’ button to execute the script. 

A dialog will open to ask for additional permissions. Allow access to your calendar.

In the left side menu, click “My Triggers”, the clock icon.

Click “Add trigger”.

Select “ColorEvents” in the list of functions to trigger.

Change the type to “Minutes” and select “15 minutes”.

Save the trigger. This will run the script, and color code any new events added to your calendar, every 15 minutes. 

In the left side menu, click “Editor”, the “< >” icon, to customize the script to your own color coding system using the suggestions in the second half of this article (below).
